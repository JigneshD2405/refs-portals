1)Components :-
==>Component are JS function that returns rendered value(HTML)
==>Any Website can be break down in small block this small blocks are called Components.React is ther combination of this Component
==>Component Name must start with uppercase character if multi words then in pascalcase i.e MyHeader
==>Component function must return rendered value
==>Built in Component :- started with lower case character rendered as dom node
==>Custom Component :- started with uppercase character 
2)JSX =javascript syntax extension:-
==>It must be return rendered content
==>function with uppercase charcater and return rendered content

3)Props :-
Props passed data from one Component to another Component
   <TabButton>Component</TabButton> this Component will pass as children in props this is bydefault pass by React



BY default React Component  execute only once 
for tell  react  Component to re render

use Hooks only in function Component only in top level function Component

Forworded props
Multiple Component Slots
Element Identifiers as Props
Default props Values




<=================Tic Tac Toe ==================================================>
Image Store in public folder vs Src/any folder
Image store in public folder is publicaly available for all user it can be directly acceessible localhost:5173/some-image.jpg by using URL
if is directly use in index.html then it is stored in image
Image store in src folder is NOT publically available for all user if it try to load by above URL  it will get error


Lec 76 :-
   Component Isolation
   when one Component is used multiple time this multiple Components are isolated from each other   means when something is changed then it is not effect other component


Lec  78 :-
   best  way to update state based on old state is pass it as like function for example 
   setIsEditing (!isEditing) this is not good practice instead of this use it as like setIsEditing(wasEditing =>{!wasEditing})
   why not setIsEditing (!isEditing) 
      because behind the scene react is scheduling this means this is not instantly update but it will take some time (here it is very minor means in milisecond for in micro second) to perform operation
      default isEditing ==false
      for better remember function handleEdit (){
         setIsEditing(!isEditing)  ==> will changed to true 
         setIsEditing(!isEditing) ==> will changed to true
      }
      above bothe will give same output



// Javascript
Javascript does not have strong type means does not  require veriable type at the time of variable declaration

primitive types ==>
   String ,Number,Boolean, Undefined , Null, Symbol
   It is stored in stack (limited memory)

Reference type ==>
   Array,Object, 
   It is stored in heap (much memory)
   for object create new memory location :- let secondPerson=Object.assign({},person)
   as for Array wil array =array.slice()  zero argument

primitive vs Reference
link ==>https://youtu.be/9ooYYRLdg_g?si=YTO-hDk_3iJRvYnR



Why directly not update object or Array because it is Reference type and will update memory location directly before it execute so first create copy of that and update that copy




Disadvantages Of Inline Style:-
Style every Element individualy


Vanila CSS :- 
CSS is not scoped to perticular component 

CSS modules are used for scoping i.e. file name can be header.module.css
Disadvantages of styled Component:- No separation of React & CSS

Tailwind Disadvantages :- Long className ,so many small component


Reference Vs state
When Ref is updated then Component is not reExecute in react
